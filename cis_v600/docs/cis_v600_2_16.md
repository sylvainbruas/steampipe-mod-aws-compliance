## Description

AWS provides a support center that can be used for incident notification and response, as well as technical support and customer services. Create an IAM Role, with the appropriate policy assigned, to allow authorized users to manage incidents with AWS Support.

## Remediation

### From Console:

1. From `All Services`, click `IAM`.
2. Under `Access Managemen`t, click `Policies`.
3. In the `Policies search field`, search for 'AWSSupportAccess'.
4. Click the policy name 'AWSSupportAccess'.
5. Click the `Entities Attached` menu and click `Attach`.
6. Add the appropriate role or roles and click `Attach policy`.

### From Command Line:


1. Create an IAM role for managing incidents with AWS:

 - Create a trust relationship policy document that allows <iam_user> to manage AWS incidents, and save it locally as /tmp/TrustPolicy.json:

```bash
{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
  {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
    "AWS": "<iam_user>"
  },
  "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
  ]
}
```

2. Create the IAM role using the above trust policy:
3. aws iam create-role --role-name <aws_support_iam_role> --assume-rolepolicy-document file:///tmp/TrustPolicy.json
4. Attach 'AWSSupportAccess' managed policy to the created IAM role:
5. aws iam attach-role-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AWSSupportAccess --role-name <aws_support_iam_role>

### Default Value:

By default, AWS does not create a dedicated support role. IAM users and roles with sufficient privileges (such as AdministratorAccess) can access the Support Center unless a specific role with the AWSSupportAccess policy is created.
