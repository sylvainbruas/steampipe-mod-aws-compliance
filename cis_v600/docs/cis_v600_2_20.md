## Description

In multi-account environments, IAM user centralization facilitates greater user control. User access beyond the initial account is then provided via role assumption. Centralization of users can be accomplished through federation with an external identity provider or through the use of AWS Organizations.

## Remediation

The remediation procedure will vary based on each individual organization's implementation of identity federation and/or AWS Organizations, with the acceptance criteria that no non-service IAM users and non-root accounts are present outside the account providing centralized IAM user management.

### Default Value:

By default, AWS accounts are created and managed independently. IAM users are local to each account unless centralized management is explicitly configured through identity federation or AWS Organizations.
