## Description

With the creation of an AWS account, a 'root user' is created that cannot be disabled or deleted. That user has unrestricted access to and control over all resources in the AWS account. It is highly recommended that the use of this account be avoided for everyday tasks.

## Remediation

If you find that the 'root' user account is being used for daily activities, including administrative tasks that do not require the 'root' user:

1. Change the 'root' user password.
2. Deactivate or delete any access keys associated with the 'root' user

Remember, anyone who has 'root' user credentials for your AWS account has unrestricted access to and control of all the resources in your account, including billing information.

### Default Value:

By default, the AWS root user is created with full administrative privileges and no restrictions. The root account remains permanently enabled and can perform all actions in the account unless explicitly limited by using alternative IAM users and roles.
