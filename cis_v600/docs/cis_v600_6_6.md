## Description

Once a VPC peering connection is established, routing tables must be updated to enable any connections between the peered VPCs. These routes can be as specific as desired, even allowing for the peering of a VPC to only a single host on the other side of the connection.

## Remediation

Remove and add route table entries to ensure that the least number of subnets or hosts required to accomplish the purpose of peering are routable.

### From Command Line:

1. For each `<route-table-id>` that contains routes that are non-compliant with your routing policy (granting more access than desired), delete the non-compliant route:

```bash
aws ec2 delete-route --route-table-id <route-table-id> --destination-cidrblock <non-compliant-destination-cidr>
```

2. Create a new compliant route:

```bash
aws ec2 create-route --route-table-id <route-table-id> --destination-cidrblock <compliant-destination-cidr> --vpc-peering-connection-id <peeringconnection-id>
```

## Default Value:

By default, AWS allows full routing between peered VPCs once routes are added. There is no automatic restriction to “least access”—administrators must manually scope routes to the minimum required CIDR blocks or hosts.
