## Description

Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) supports encryption at rest when using the Elastic Block Store (EBS) service. While disabled by default, forcing encryption at EBS volume creation is supported.

## Remediation

### From Console:

1. Login to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon EC2 console using https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
2. Under `Account attributes`, click `Data protection and security.`
3. Under `EBS encryption`, Click `Manage`.
4. Check the `Enable` box to default encryption.
5. Click `Update EBS encryption.`
6. Repeat for each region in which EBS volume encryption is not enabled by default.

**Note**: EBS volume encryption is configured per region.

### From Command Line:

1. Run the following command:

```bash
aws --region <region> ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default
```
2. Verify that `"EbsEncryptionByDefault": true`is displayed.
3. Repeat for each region in which EBS volume encryption is not enabled by default.

**Note**: EBS volume encryption is configured per region.

## Default Value:

By default, EBS volume encryption is disabled. It must be manually enabled per region; otherwise, new EBS volumes are created unencrypted.
