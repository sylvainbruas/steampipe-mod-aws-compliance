## Description

The Network Access Control List (NACL) function provides stateless filtering of ingress and egress network traffic to AWS resources. It is recommended that no NACL allows unrestricted ingress access to remote server administration ports, such as SSH on port 22 and RDP on port 3389, using either the TCP (6), UDP (17), or ALL (-1) protocols.

## Remediation

### From Console:

Perform the following steps to remediate a network ACL:

1. Login to the AWS VPC Console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home.
2. In the left pane, click `Network ACLs.`
3. For each network ACL that needs remediation, perform the following:
  - Select the network ACL.
  - Click the `Inbound Rules` tab.
  - Click `Edit inbound rules.`
  - Either (A) update the Source field to a range other than 0.0.0.0/0, or (B) click `Delete` to remove the offending inbound rule.
- Click `Save`.

## Default Value:

By default, NACLs start with rules that allow all inbound/ outbound traffic (or deny all if custom), and administrators may configure them to allow 0.0.0.0/0. AWS does not automatically restrict ports like SSH (22) or RDP (3389); controls must be set manually.
